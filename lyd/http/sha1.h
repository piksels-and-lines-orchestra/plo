/* LibTomCrypt, modular cryptographic library -- Tom St Denis
 *
 * LibTomCrypt is a library that provides various cryptographic
 * algorithms in a highly modular and flexible manner.
 *
 * The library is free for all purposes without any express
 * guarantee it works.

 * Tom St Denis, tomstdenis@gmail.com, http://libtom.org
 *
 * The plain ANSIC sha1 functionality has been extracted from libtomcrypt,
 * and is included directly in the sources. /Ã˜yvind K. - since libtomcrypt
 * is public domain the adaptations done here to make the sha1 self contained
 * also is public domain.
