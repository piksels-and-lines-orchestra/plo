\scene{ --- The design bureau on an afternoon}

Eliza is now wearing more up-to-date clothing, all black, black-rimmed glasses and has black short, severe hair.

Mrs. Hinting, Hinting's mother, comes in.  She is part owner of the company and has connected them with their best customers.  she is a classy lady of around 65.

Hinting explains to his mother that he has taken a "trashy copy-shop girl" and is teaching her how to act like a designer.  

He talks trash about their customers who happen to be good friends of his mother.  

Mother asks eliza about her work.  Eliza proceeds to show more classic Swiss style "correct" design.  She uses many inarticulate or teenage-type words to describe what she is working on.  She describes how they would be nice for advertizing a liquor store or that these abstract forms might make a "real nice sign" for a hair salon.

NOTE: we need some nice/ironic rip-offs of iconic designs / logos / type

He asks his mother what she thinks.  She says that she is going to have a hard time speaking to real customers and that she is concerned about what this girl is going to do when she is done with her internship.
