\scene{ --- The design bureau late in the evening}

It is late and E, H and P come in.  They are slightly dressed up but looking disheveled (drunk).  Eliza sits, making repetitive small sounds with inkscape, brooding.

P congratulates H and tells him he's won the bet.  H says its all just a joke and he's frankly been sick of it for the last few weeks and glad it's over.

he asks E to prepare coffee and slides for the client meeting tomorrow.

H and P go out for a smoke.  E is furious and draws a brutal spiky shape that makes a lot of noise.

H comes back and looking for the pantone book.  Eliza goes for a second back stage and returns with the book which she throws at him.

argument about E's future.  H says she should get together with a nice art director.  She gives back her wig, glasses, iphone, etc.  H is hurt.  he throws the iphone in the corner.

They argue and H says that she is an "egocentric tasteless copyshop tart".  He storms out.  E goes to find the iphone.
