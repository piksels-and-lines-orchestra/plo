\scene{ --- A design bureau at 9:30 AM}

\dialog{Narrator} The Scene: it is monday morning.  We find ourselves in the offices of the design agency "Raster and Servant".

\dialog{Narrator} The employees are ariving and slowly getting to work.

Slow, not-so lout operations, drawing, layouts, image editing.

\dialog{Narrator} A young woman approaches, seemingly unsure of herself.  She is ignored.

\dialog{Narrator} Henry Raster, the director of the agency, wonders who this "badly dressed" young lady is and what she wants?

Hilde motions to Liza to come over.  They have a short whispered exchange.  Hilde looks skeptical.

\dialog{Narrator} Her name is Liza and she would like to apply to be the new intern. 

Raster shreiks and nearly falls out of his chair.

\dialog{Narrator} Raster is alarmed and concerned that his once great reputation may be in decline.   

Raster makes alarmed designs.

\dialog{Narrator} Joseph Kern is an older, more experienced designer who got his start in the pre-digital era.  He thinks they should take a look at Liza's portfolio.

\dialog{Narrator} Raster reluctantly agrees.

Solo, slideshow of Liza's portfolio.  It consists of quite a few vernacular designs incorporating elements that are no-no's in the conventional design world: comic sans, drop shadows, excessive borders, rainbows, etc.  Raster is alarmed.

\dialog{Narrator} Raster feels Liza should leave the building as soon as possible, otherwise someone might see these images or her clothing.

Raster imports kitchy images into his layout and then covers them up.

\dialog{Narrator} Liza finds her hopes dashed. She will have to go back to working in the copy shop.

Liza lays out sad faces and turns her rainbows black and white.

\dialog{Narrator} Kern reminds Raster of a recent boast.  He claimed he could teach the most amateur GIMP jockey to pass for a Madison Avenue art director, given a few months of training in cliches.

Raster makes boastful designs.

\dialog{Narrator} Kern suggests they have a friendly bet that they take Liza on and teach her to fake it. 

Raster lays out the question "what terms?".

\dialog{Narrator} Raster suggests 3 months and 50 Bitcoins.  

Raster sets the title "Challenge Accepted!".  I will prevail!

\dialog{Narrator} Raster instructs Hilde to take Liza out back and to burn her clothes.  She should order some new outfits in Black and Grey from Benneton.  And an iPhone.

Hilde makes changes to photos to reduce contrast to greyscale, etc.

End act.  Lights down.
