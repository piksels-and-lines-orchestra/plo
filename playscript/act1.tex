\scene{ --- A design bureau at 9:30 AM}

Employees arriving.  Drinking coffee.  Sitting down. Busily looking at screens.  Some small sounds come from occasional design actions 

Eliza, a slightly nerdy looking young woman enters from the back of the stage, holding a portfolio.  She is wearing a tacky, oversized sweatshirt with fred flintstone (or similar) on it and glasses that went out of style 10 years ago.

She stands for several minutes watching the members of the company work unsure about approaching them.

%\def\Hinting{\dialog{Hinting}}

{Who the fuck is this Hannah Barbarian wallflower standing over there?}

Hinting and Pikseling make fun of her clothing

she is apparently here to interview to be the new intern

oh god!

SOLO: slide show of her very tacky / prolo / dirt-style portfolio 

eliza is very motivated and wants to be a "real" designer.  Pikseling reminds Hinting that he claimed he could make any photoshop-jockey pass for a Madison Ave creative director given a few months of cliches and training.

NOTE: we need big help from designers here

Hinting and Pikseling have a bet

Eliza's father, the proprietor of a sign shop shows up.  He is a bit of a bum.  he shakes down Hinting for a little bit of money. a "transfer fee" like in football.

The assistant is sent off with eliza and told to burn her clothes and order a new outfit from Muji.
