\scene{ --- A design bureau at 9:30 AM}

Employees arriving.  Drinking coffee.  Sitting down. Busily looking at screens.  Some small sounds come from occasional design actions 

Eliza, a slightly nerdy looking young woman enters from the back of the stage, holding a portfolio.  She is wearing a tacky, oversized sweatshirt with fred flintstone (or similar) on it, a large bow in her hair, white sneakers and glasses that went out of style 10 years ago.

She stands for several minutes watching the members of the company work unsure about approaching them.


\Kern Who the fuck is the charity store refugee lurking in the corner?

\Raster Oh my! Are they shooting an early 90s period film about color blind sports fans?

\Kern You are good!

\Kern So what the hell does she want?

Hilde motions to Liza to come over.  They have a short whispered exchange.  Hilde looks skeptical.

\Hilde Um.  Apparently, she wants to apply to be our new intern.

Kern shreiks and nearly falls out of his chair.

\Kern WHAT!?  Oh fuck no!

\Raster Well I guess I should never have given up my childhood dreams of dancing at the Bolshoi.

\Kern Tell her to sit down.

\Liza Hi!  I rlly want to be ur intern.  U are sriously pro designers! :)

\Kern Could you maybe start by telling us your name.

\Liza Oh right srry.  Nervous!  I'm Liza.  Liza Doolittle.

\Kern Kern.  I assume, if you know anything at all, you have heard of me.

\Liza mm.  yeah.  somebody said ur super good.

\Raster Nice to meet you Liza.  My name is Raster.

\Kern So what makes you think we would want you at all?  Where did you study?  RCA?

\Liza no...

\Kern RISD?  Universitaet der Kuenste?  Willem de Kooning?

\Liza no erm.  i havent been to college.

\Raster Oh I see.  So you are self-taught?

\Liza yeah!  I work in a copy shop.  I took a night course in ArtySuite TS-9. And I got a book for christmas.  Learn to make killer PhotoStore version 12.666 images in just 24 hours. 

\Kern The depravity.  Shocking.

\Raster Interesting.  So how about showing us your portfolio?

\Kern No way.  Don't waste my fucking time.

\Raster Henry, be nice.  Liza can you just give us a quick overview?

\Liza ok
SOLO: slide show of her very tacky / prolo / dirt-style portfolio 
Kern talks trash the whole time.  Moaning, sighing.  Oh my eyes! etc.
Raster is more generous but obviously not impressed.

\Liza{so, what do you think?}

eliza is very motivated and wants to be a "real" designer.  Pikseling reminds Hinting that he claimed he could make any photoshop-jockey pass for a Madison Ave creative director given a few months of cliches and training.

Hinting and Pikseling have a bet

Eliza's father, the proprietor of a sign shop shows up.  He is a bit of a bum.  he shakes down Hinting for a little bit of money. a "transfer fee" like in football.

The assistant is sent off with eliza and told to burn her clothes and order a new outfit from Muji.
