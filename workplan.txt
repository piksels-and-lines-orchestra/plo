6th: Work starts

Tuesday

Meet with Line Nord at USF Verftet and Anna Borcheding at Piksel.
Got practical information and a tour of USF facilities, including Brendans
apartment and the studio that is at our disposal.

In the studio, went over the artistic proposal and discussed the vision
and its realization. 

Had a meeting with Elisabeth Nesheim and Gisle Fr√∏ysland at Piksel where
the terms of the residency were formalized in a written contract. Recieved
a workstation that can be used to develop and present the prototype for the Piksel festival.

Lunch/early dinner with Elisabeth at Sze Chuan House. Discussions around
the problems of preservating new-media artworks, and how current man-machine interfaces are severely lacking.

Created git repositories to contain code and documentation.

Agreed on which tasks need to be adressed during the 3-week residency in Bergen,
and which can be skipped until after the Piksel festival.

Published the code that was available from the PLO prototype from LGRU Piksels & Lines
seminar in June, Bergen. Sent email request to LGRU list that participants of the
meeting make the code they wrote available as well.
