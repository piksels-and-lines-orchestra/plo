The sound server for PLO is based on SuperCollider
For SuperCollider introduction and reference documentation,
see http://sccode.org/ and http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/

Please note that the code was written by two people quite new
to SuperCollider (though not to programming), so the code is
very likely not ideomatic SC code.
