Ideas
=======

* Use an actual/explicit 'narrator' character in the chat.
* Use an email-driven monolog or soliloquy to complement the dialog in the chat.
* Use the scripting interfaces, or create scripts in the source code
of applications to generate and playback of visual sequences.
* Use a presentation tool with a pre-created presentation
to show parts of the story/narrative, to complement the text-centric
chat/email with visuals.
* Have (improvised) "solos" featuring the individual instruments/players
as part of the score.
* Establish the principle operation of the performance system as part of the
introduction or the first act.
* Position the different players at different positions in the sound-field
 to help the audience distinguish them from eachother.
