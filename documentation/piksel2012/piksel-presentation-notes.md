Piksel presentation
====================

--------
Background 
 - LGRU meeting in june.  artistic / unconventional approaches to design and tools. (explain what LGRU is)
 - discussion of live coding, writing as performance, exposing the process and mechanism of design.  also discussion of group working practices and source control.
 - mapping one medium to another.  turning tools into instruments.  
 - notion of labor. the sounds are mapped to actions, gestures and artistic decisions. notion of virtuosity.  gimp is your instrument.
 - narrative layer.  work is always a story.
 - an opera. loosely based on Pygmallion. brings in notions of class, culture, knowlege, discourse communities, faking it, professionalism as performance. lots of satire. (also stealing from other stories and plays)
 - the media of the subject become the instruments of performance.  no more dancing about architecture.  design explains itself through its own machanisms. thats also why we use IM for the libretto.
 - goal is to show what its like to work in the design world.  dramatic but realistic.
