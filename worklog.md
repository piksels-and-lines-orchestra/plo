Week 1: Tuesday, 6th of November
=========================

Meet with Line Nord at USF Verftet and Anna Borcheding at Piksel.
Got practical information and a tour of USF facilities, including Brendans
apartment and the studio that is at our disposal.

In the studio, went over the artistic proposal and discussed the vision
and its realization. 

Had a meeting with Elisabeth Nesheim and Gisle Fr√∏ysland at Piksel where
the terms of the residency were formalized in a written contract. Recieved
a workstation that can be used to develop and present the prototype for the Piksel festival.

Lunch/early dinner with Elisabeth at Sze Chuan House. Discussions around
the problems of preservating new-media artworks, and how current man-machine interfaces are severely lacking.

Created git repositories to contain code and documentation.
https://github.com/piksels-and-lines-orchestra
Agreed on which tasks need to be adressed during the 3-week residency in Bergen,
and which can be skipped until after the Piksel festival.

Published the code that was available from the PLO prototype from LGRU Piksels & Lines
seminar in June, Bergen. Sent email request to LGRU list that participants of the
meeting make the code they wrote available as well.

Wednesday, 7th
===========================

Brendan researched plays and stories to base our plot-line and characters on.
Also set up SuperCollider and started evaluating it for use in the sonification server.

Femke Snelting provided the Scribus code that was developed at LGRU Piksels & Lines seminar.

Jon defined an OSC event protocol to be used between players and sonification server,
and implemented this new event protocol in player software: MyPaint, GIMP, Scribus
Also wrote some small test patches/applications in PureData and Python for recieving
this data.

Thanks to Elisabeth, we got a basic website up and running at http://www.piksel.no/pulse/plo
and access to change it.

Thursday, 8th
=============================

Jon downloaded and built Inkscape. Created git repository for it and pushed to PLO repository.
No implementation of the PLO event protocol yet.
Together we wrote a SuperCollider OSC reciever test, and played with triggering 
simple musical patterns.

Friday, 9th
===============================

Jon researched some papers and books on musical cognition, perception and emotional impact.
Ordered a few for reading after the Piksel festival, and before the Future Tools Conference performance.

More playing around with SuperCollider. Brendan implemented some Steve Reich-styled 
progressions, and Jon made it so that these respond to changes coming in over OSC. Ran into
many gotyahs in the SuperCollider languages while trying to exploit some of the more
powerful constructs and objects. More or less decided on SC now?

Had meeting with Elisabeth starting at 16.00. Updated the website with new basic information about
the project. Should be an OK basis for the Piksel program and translation into Norwegian for
initial dissemination.

Later / Undecided
===============================

* Implement event protocol also in: Inkscape [Jon]
* Develop a simple test scenario/case for the sonification server.
* Try out test scenario with the different technologies. Pure Data, CSound, SuperCollider
* Decide on which sonification technology to use.
* Set up audio server workstation.
* Instrument Thunderbird to be able to monitor emails
* Evaluate and decide on technical system for visuals.
